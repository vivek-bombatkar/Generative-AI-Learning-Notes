# 00 LLM Basics | Reference Prompts and Definitions

This document provides reusable prompts for each major subtopic under "LLM Basic," along with definitions only for concepts unlikely to become outdated. 

---

## 1. LLM Basic Concept

**Definition**:  
A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast text data to understand and generate human language.

**Prompt**:  
- *"Explain the core concept of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their primary function in AI."*

---

## 2. Key Factors for Selecting a Language Model

**Prompt**:  
- *"List and explain the main factors to consider when choosing a language model for a business or research use case."*

---

## 3. Inference Parameters

**Prompt**:  
- *"Describe the main inference parameters (such as temperature, top-k, top-p, response length, length penalty, stop sequences) and how each affects LLM output."*

---

## 4. Popular Chat Models

**Prompt**:  
- *"Compare the most popular LLM chat models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 2, PaLM 2, LLaMA 2, Mistral 7B) in terms of architecture, parameter size, strengths, weaknesses, and use cases."*

---

## 5. Open-Weight vs. Closed-Weight Models

**Definition**:  
- **Open-weight models**: Models whose trained parameters (weights) are publicly available for download, allowing inspection, modification, and fine-tuning.
- **Closed-weight models**: Models where only API access is provided; internal weights are not shared.

**Prompt**:  
- *"Explain the difference between open-weight and closed-weight LLMs, and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages."*

---

## 6. Downloading Model Weights vs. the Actual Model

**Prompt**:  
- *"Clarify the distinction between downloading just the model weights and downloading the full model (architecture + weights), with examples."*

---

## 7. Ideal Business Use Cases

**Prompt**:  
- *"Summarize the ideal business use cases for prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and LLM fine-tuning, including when to use each approach."*

---

## 8. LLM Performance Metrics

**Prompt**:  
- *"List and define the main metrics used to evaluate LLM performance, such as accuracy, coherence, groundedness, fluency, relevance, and similarity."*

---

## 9. Subtopics

### a. Model Alignment and Safety

**Prompt**:  
- *"What is model alignment in LLMs, and why is safety important in real-world applications?"*

### b. LLM Limitations and Risks

**Prompt**:  
- *"Discuss common limitations and risks associated with LLMs, such as hallucinations, bias, and privacy concerns."*

### c. LLM Ecosystem and Community

**Prompt**:  
- *"Describe the importance of ecosystem support and community contributions in the development and adoption of LLMs."*

---

## 10. General Prompt for Any LLM Subtopic

- *"Explain [subtopic] in the context of Large Language Models, including its definition, importance, and practical examples."*
