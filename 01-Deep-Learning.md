# 01 Deep Learning

- Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses algorithmic structures called neural networks. 
- These are based upon the structure of the human brain.
- In deep learning models, we use software modules called nodes to simulate the behavior of neurons.
- Deep neural networks comprise layers of nodes, including an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer of nodes.
- Every `node` in the neural network autonomously assigns `weights` to each `feature`.
- Information flows through the network in a forward direction from input to output.
- During training, the `difference` between the `predicted` output and the `actual` output is then calculated.
- The `weights` of the neurons are repeatedly adjusted to minimize the error.
