## 01 Deep Learning
- Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses algorithmic structures called neural networks. 
- In deep learning models, we use software modules called nodes to simulate the behavior of neurons.
- Deep neural networks comprise layers of nodes, including an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer of nodes.
- Every `node` in the neural network autonomously assigns `weights` to each `feature`.
- Information flows through the network in a forward direction from input to output.
- During training, the `difference` between the `predicted` output and the `actual` output is then calculated.
- The `weights` of the neurons are repeatedly adjusted to minimize the error.

## Generative AI
- Generative AI is accomplished by using deep learning models that are pre-trained on extremely large datasets containing strings of text or, in AI terms, sequences.
- They use `transformer` neural networks, which change an input sequence, in Gen AI known as prompt, into an output sequence, which is the response to your prompt.
- Neural networks process the elements of a sequence `sequentially` one word at a time.
- Transformers process the sequence in `parallel`, which speeds up the training and allows much bigger datasets to be used.
- Large language models contain many billions of features, which captures a wide range of human knowledge.

- Data drift is when there are significant changes to the data distribution compared to the data used for training. 
- Concept drift is when the properties of the target variables change.
- Accuracy measures how close the predicted class values are to the actual values.
- The formula for accuracy is the number of true positives plus true negatives divided by the total number of predictions.

- Precision measures how well an algorithm predicts true positives out of all the positives that it identifies.
- The formula is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives, plus the number of false positives.
