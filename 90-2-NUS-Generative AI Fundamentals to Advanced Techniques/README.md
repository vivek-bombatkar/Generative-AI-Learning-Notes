# Reinforcement Learning vs Supervised Learning
- **Supervised Learning:** A learning paradigm where a model is trained on labelled input-output pairs and receives direct feedback on errors.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A learning paradigm where an agent learns by interacting with an environment using rewards and penalties.

### Supervised Learning
1. Collect labelled data.
2. Split into training and validation sets.
3. Train model to minimize loss.
4. Evaluate performance.

### Reinforcement Learning
1. Initialize agent and environment.
2. Perform actions based on current policy.
3. Receive reward feedback.
4. Update policy using reward signal.
5. Repeat until convergence.

## Examples
- **Supervised Learning:** Image classification, spam detection, price prediction.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Game playing, robotics control, recommendation strategies with delayed rewards.
