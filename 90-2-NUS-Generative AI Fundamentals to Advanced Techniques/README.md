## Transformers and Attention Mechanisms

### Attention Mechanism in Transformers

#### Attention
At the core of modern NLP lies **attention**.  
It allows models to **focus**, not memorise.  
Instead of treating all words equally, attention helps the model decide **what matters most** in context. citeturn15view0  

A commonly used formulation is scaled dot-product attention:  
**Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) · V**. citeturn15view0  

#### Query, Key, and Value (QKV)

To understand attention, everything revolves around three components:

- 🔍 **Query (Q)**  
  - Represents the **current word or token**
  - Think of it as a word *asking* for relevant context citeturn15view0  

- 🗝️ **Key (K)**  
  - Represents **all words in the input sequence**
  - Each word has a key used to measure relevance to the query citeturn15view0  

- 📦 **Value (V)**  
  - Contains the **actual information** (embeddings)
  - This is the content passed forward once relevance is determined citeturn15view0  

#### How Attention Works (Step-by-Step)

- Compute **attention scores** using dot products between Query and Keys. citeturn15view0  
- Scale scores by **√dₖ** for stability. citeturn15view0  
- Apply **softmax** to get a probability distribution over tokens. citeturn15view0  
- Take the **weighted sum of Values** to produce a context-aware representation. citeturn15view0  

#### Why Attention Matters
- Focuses on **relevant words**, regardless of position citeturn15view0  
- Handles **long-range dependencies** citeturn15view0  
- Essential for understanding meaning in complex sentences citeturn15view0  

### Multi-Head Attention

#### What is Multi-Head Attention?
- Instead of one attention mechanism, the model uses **multiple heads**
- Each head attends to **different aspects** of the sequence citeturn15view0  

#### How It Works
- Input is split into multiple Q, K, V sets  
- Each head computes attention **independently**  
- Outputs are:
  - Concatenated
  - Passed through a linear layer  
➡️ Result. richer and more expressive representations citeturn15view0  

### Feedforward Networks (FFN)

#### Role of Feedforward Networks

### Encoder–decoder models and key examples

#### Encoder-decoder models
Encoder–decoder models are a fundamental architecture in modern deep learning. These models bring together an encoder and a decoder, enabling efficient processing of input data while generating meaningful output. citeturn15view0turn2search4  

- Start with the encoder, which takes the input and processes it to capture its contextual meaning. It transforms the data into a structured representation that the model can understand. citeturn15view0  
- Then comes the decoder, which uses that structured information to generate text that is natural and coherent. Unlike simple text generation models that produce output sequentially, encoder-decoder models maintain logical consistency by referencing the complete context provided by the encoder. citeturn15view0  

#### Applications of encoder–decoder models
Encoder–decoder models power a variety of real-world applications including:
- Machine translation to convert text from one language to another citeturn15view0turn2search4  
- Text summarisation, extracting the key points while preserving the meaning citeturn2search4turn2search2  
- Caption generation, generating textual descriptions for images or videos citeturn3search1  

#### BART
BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) is a hybrid model that integrates the strengths of both BERT and GPT, making it highly effective for tasks requiring text reconstruction and controlled generation. citeturn2search1  

- It employs a bidirectional encoding process (similar to BERT) for comprehensive contextual understanding. citeturn2search1  
- It uses denoising objectives such as span corruption / text infilling (replacing spans with a single mask token), forcing reconstruction of phrases while maintaining coherence. citeturn2search1  
- On the decoding side, BART adopts autoregressive generation (similar to GPT), where tokens are generated one at a time while conditioning on the encoded input. citeturn2search1turn15view0  

##### BART’s Denoising Process
BART employs a denoising autoencoder approach, where input data is deliberately corrupted before being passed through the model. citeturn2search1  

Noise-insertion techniques described in the notes:
- Token masking replaces random words with a special [MASK] token. citeturn2search1  
- Token deletion removes entire words from the sequence. citeturn2search1  
- Text infilling (span corruption) replaces entire spans of text with a single [MASK] token. citeturn2search1  

This training strategy makes BART robust to noisy or incomplete inputs (e.g., imperfect formatting or missing spans) and supports tasks like summarisation, paraphrasing, translation, and text completion. citeturn2search1  

#### PEGASUS
PEGASUS (Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarisation) is specifically designed to enhance text summarisation by masking entire sentences rather than individual tokens during pretraining. citeturn2search2turn2search10  

Key points from the notes:
- Entire sentences (instead of tokens) are masked during pretraining. citeturn2search2  
- Sentences may be randomly identified, though the method focuses on removing “important” sentences (gap sentence generation). citeturn2search2  
- These are identified to be ones with high similarity to the rest of the document (intuitively encouraging summary-like targets). citeturn2search2  

PEGASUS achieves strong summarisation performance and can require minimal fine-tuning for high-quality abstractive summaries. citeturn2search2turn2search10  

#### T5
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) reformulates all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format, using an encoder-decoder architecture for tasks like translation, summarisation, and Q&A. citeturn2search4  

Text to Text
- Indicative of the types of input and output to be expected citeturn2search4  
- Encoder model used to get information for input text citeturn2search4  
- Decoder model used to generate output text citeturn2search4  

Transfer Transformer
- Transformer capable of employing transfer learning citeturn2search4  
- Allows for multiple NLP tasks to be accomplished by the model:
  - Translation
  - Summarisation
  - Q&A citeturn2search4  

T5 uses task prefixes (instructions) to unify workflows across tasks (e.g., “translate …”, “summarize …”). citeturn2search4  

## Alignment, Reliability, and Knowledge Grounding

### GPT and Reinforcement Learning

GPT models, built on deep learning, have revolutionised language understanding and generation by predicting text patterns with remarkable fluency. Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, empowers systems to learn through trial and error, optimising actions for long-term rewards. Together, they unlock new frontiers in adaptive, intelligent decision-making and human-like interactions. citeturn5search0turn1search7  

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances GPT’s ability to generate not just human-like text but also reliable and contextually appropriate responses. citeturn1search1turn13view0  

Why RLHF is used (as captured in the notes and discussion):
- GPT can produce fluent language, but a pure Transformer architecture does not *inherently* verify factual accuracy or suitability of outputs. citeturn13view0turn1search1  
- Example (preserved): “Under Augustus, the Roman Empire came to [MASK]” — GPT alone may not “know” which completion is historically correct without grounding or reliable internal knowledge. citeturn13view0turn1search1  

Typical RLHF-style pipeline:
- A model is fine-tuned using a **reward model** (often a transformer trained on human preference rankings) that prioritizes more useful outputs. citeturn1search1turn1search5  
- Human reviewers evaluate and correct a subset of responses, reinforcing high-quality and informative text generation. citeturn1search1turn1search5  

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances GPT by integrating external knowledge sources, addressing its limitations with fixed training data. citeturn1search2turn1search6  

Key points (preserved and clarified):
- ChatGPT generates responses off fixed training data. citeturn13view0  
- Without external sources, it struggles with real-time updates, niche topics, or retrieving specific factual details. citeturn1search2turn13view0  
- RAG retrieves relevant documents or data (e.g., knowledge bases, web snapshots, or indexed corpora), feeding them into the model as additional context for response generation. citeturn1search2turn1search6  
- This approach improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and enables up-to-date, domain-specific answers. citeturn1search2turn13view0  
- Combining GPT-style models with retrieval creates more reliable, informed, and adaptable AI systems for business and research applications. citeturn1search2turn1search6  

### Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)

Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) enables GPT to perform tasks without additional training, relying solely on its extensive pretraining. Instead of requiring labeled examples or fine-tuning: citeturn1search7  

- GPT leverages its extensive pre-training to perform tasks without additional training, generating relevant outputs directly from prompt instruction. citeturn1search7  
- Enhanced flexibility: allows adaptation to new tasks without extra fine-tuning. citeturn1search7  
- Streamlined workflow: reduces the need for task-specific fine-tuning. citeturn1search7  
- Can be more efficient for real-time applications—enhancing overall productivity. citeturn1search7  

### Model Temperature

Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of token selection during inference (commonly described as scaling logits before softmax). citeturn6search0  

Notes (preserved):
- Future tokens picked via probability distribution citeturn6search0  
- Higher probability = higher chance of selection citeturn6search0  
- Temperature scaling adjusts randomness in word selection. citeturn6search0  
- Tuning temperature balances precision and creativity in generated text. citeturn6search0  

### Challenges in Text Generation

#### Hallucinations
- Generates plausible but incorrect information
- Caused by missing or weak training signals citeturn13view0  

#### Bias
- Models inherit biases from training data
- Can reflect:
  - Gender bias
  - Cultural bias
  - Racial bias citeturn13view0  

#### Ethics
- Risks include:
  - Misinformation
  - Plagiarism
  - Copyright issues citeturn13view0  
- Potential misuse:
  - Fake news
  - Opinion manipulation citeturn13view0  
- Requires:
  - Better data curation
  - Bias mitigation
  - Strong ethical guidelines citeturn13view0  

## Multimodal and Generalist Models

### Multimodal models

Multimodal models are designed to process multiple types of data, moving beyond the traditional text based inputs. These models integrate different modalities such as text, image, audio, and video, allowing AI to understand and generate more contextually rich outputs. citeturn3search0turn3search1  

Instead of relying on a single data type, multimodal models combine multiple inputs to enhance their decision making and interpretation. To achieve this, separate architectures are often used for different data types. citeturn3search0turn3search1  

Examples from the notes:
- ViLBERT – 2 separate models for text and videos citeturn3search0  
- Show & Tell – CNN based model for images, LSTM for text captioning citeturn3search1  

Clarification (added to preserve intent while tightening accuracy):
- ViLBERT is a **two-stream** vision-and-language model with separate visual and textual streams that interact via co-attention; it is primarily presented for image+text settings but the same design pattern is often discussed in broader multimodal contexts. citeturn3search0turn3search4  

Looking at the illustration (as described in the notes), different components work together:
- CNN extracts features from an image
- A separate model such as BiLSTM processes corresponding textual data
- Outputs are then pooled or chained to form a final structured response, ensuring both image and text contribute to overall understanding citeturn3search1turn3search0  

This fusion enables tasks such as automatic captioning, video analysis, and even speech to text with contextual awareness. Multimodal learning enhances AI's ability to interpret the world more like humans by integrating multiple sensory inputs. citeturn3search0turn3search1  

Applications mentioned:
- Autonomous systems
- Accessibility tools
- Interactive AI assistance citeturn3search0turn3search1  

### Gato

GATO, developed by DeepMind in 2022, is a generalist deep neural network capable of handling text, images, video, and robotic control within a single Transformer architecture. citeturn2search3turn2search7  

Unlike traditional multimodal models, GATO does not use separate CNNs or LSTMs; instead, it tokenises all inputs into a shared format, treating different modalities as a sequence. citeturn2search3turn2search7  

This unified approach allows the model to handle diverse tasks without needing specialised architecture for each modality. citeturn2search3turn2search7  

GATO has been trained across a wide range of applications, from chat bots and gaming to robotic control, demonstrating its adaptability. citeturn2search3turn2search7  

Its versatility represents a major shift from specialised AI systems towards scalable generalist AI models that can efficiently operate across multiple domains. citeturn2search3turn2search7
