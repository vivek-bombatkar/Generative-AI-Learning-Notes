# Generative-AI-Learning-Notes
- This document provides **reusable prompts** for key subtopics under **LLMs**.
- It includes **definitions** only for concepts that are **unlikely to become outdated**.
- Using reusable prompts and only including stable definitions is a smart approach to take a notes, because it keeps your notes concise, easy to update, and always relevant.      
- Instead of relying on lengthy notes that quickly become outdated, prompts let you generate fresh, up-to-date information as the field evolves.
