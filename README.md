# Generative-AI-Learning-Notes
### This document provides reusable prompts for each major subtopic under "LLM" along with definitions only for concepts unlikely to become outdated.

Using reusable prompts and only including stable definitions is a smart approach because it keeps your notes concise, easy to update, and always relevant. 
Instead of relying on lengthy notes that quickly become outdated, prompts let you generate fresh, up-to-date information as the field evolves.
