# ReAct Prompting
- Generating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions.
- a framework named ReAct where LLMs are used to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner.
- The ReAct framework can allow LLMs to interact with external tools to retrieve additional information that leads to more reliable and factual responses.
- ReAct enables agents to provide additional context, feedback, or clarifications to the LLM, and then create updated responses based on this new information or outputs from actions taken in previous steps.
