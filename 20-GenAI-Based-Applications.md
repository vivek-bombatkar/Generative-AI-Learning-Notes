## Prompt history store
- Many FMs have a limited context window, which means you can only pass a fixed length of data as input.
- Storing state information in a multiple-turn conversation becomes a problem when the conversation exceeds the context window.
- To solve this problem, you can implement a prompt history store.
- It can persist the conversation state, making it possible to have a long-term history of the conversation.

## 2. Generative AI Application Architecture Patterns - 3 
### 1. Text summarization pattern For large documents or text
- map-reduce architecture and apply the concepts of chunking and chaining prompts.  The test summarization architecture for large documents includes the following steps:  
  1. Split a large document into multiple small number (n) chunks using tools such as LangChain.  
  2. Send each chunk to the FM to generate a corresponding summary.  
  3. Append the next chunk to the first summary generated and summarize again.  
  4. Iterate on each chunk to create a final summarized output.  
### 2. AI assistant pattern
- This architecture includes the following steps:
  1. The user queries the AI assistant.  
  2. The chat history (if there is any) is passed on to the Amazon Bedrock model along with the userâ€™s current query.    
  3. The model then generates a response.     
  4. The model passes the response back to the user.  
### 3. AI assistant use cases
  1 Basic AI assistant: This is a zero-shot AI assistant with an FM model.  
  2 AI assistant using a prompt template: This is an AI assistant with some context provided in the prompt template.  
  3 AI assistant with a persona: This is an AI assistant with defined roles, such as a career coach with human interactions.  
  4 Contextual-aware AI assistant: This is an AI assistant that passes context through an external file by generating embeddings.  



## comparison of **LangSmith**, **LangGraph**, and **LangChain** in tabular format:

| **Feature/Aspect**         | **LangSmith**                                    | **LangGraph**                                 | **LangChain**                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**         | Model evaluation, testing, and monitoring for LLM workflows. | A visual interface for building and debugging LLM pipelines. | A framework for building, managing, and deploying LLM applications with advanced chains and integrations. |
| **Use Case**                | Evaluate and monitor the performance and efficiency of LLM-based workflows. | Visualize and debug the flow of data between various components in LLM systems. | Develop LLM-powered applications, such as chatbots, RAG systems, and multi-agent pipelines. |
| **Core Focus**              | Debugging, testing, and optimizing agent behaviors and prompt workflows. | Visual design of pipelines with a focus on data flow and interaction between steps. | Flexibility in building advanced chains for LLM-based apps with extensive integrations. |
| **Strengths**               | - Testing and monitoring LLM applications. <br> - Fine-tuning and performance analysis.<br> - Great for iterating and optimizing prompts. | - Intuitive visual design interface.<br> - Real-time debugging.<br> - Best for prototyping complex workflows visually. | - Extensive integration with external tools.<br> - Pre-built components for rapid development.<br> - Customizability for chaining LLM models with additional tools (like databases). |
| **Visual Interface**        | No dedicated visual interface; mainly focused on backend testing and debugging tools. | Yes, provides a graphical interface for building and visualizing workflows. | No native visual design interface but highly modular with code-based chain building. |
| **Chain Composition**       | Supports testing of chain components but not designed to build chains directly. | Focuses on visualizing how components interact in the chain. | Build and manage complex chains, integrating LLMs with APIs, databases, and more. |
