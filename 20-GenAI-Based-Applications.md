# 20 GenAI Based Applications | Reference Prompts and Stable Definitions

This document provides **reusable prompts** for each major subtopic in GenAI-Based Applications, with definitions only for concepts unlikely to become outdated. New subtopics are suggested where relevant.

---

## 1. Typical Components of a Generative AI Application

**Prompt**:  
- "List and explain the typical components of a generative AI application, including the role of the foundation model, prompt history store, and other essential modules."  

---

## 2. Prompt History Store

**Definition**:  
A **prompt history store** is a mechanism for persisting conversation state across multiple turns, allowing generative AI applications to maintain long-term context even when the model's context window is limited[1].

**Prompt**:  
- "Explain the function and importance of a prompt history store in generative AI applications, especially for multi-turn conversations."

## 3. Generative AI Application Architecture Patterns

### a. Text Summarization Pattern

**Prompt**:  
- "Describe the text summarization architecture pattern for large documents, including how chunking, chaining prompts, and map-reduce strategies are used to generate summaries."  

### b. AI Assistant Pattern

**Prompt**:  
- "Explain the architecture of an AI assistant application, detailing the flow of user queries, chat history, model response generation, and user interaction."  

### c. AI Assistant Use Cases

**Prompt**:  
- "List and differentiate between basic AI assistants, assistants using prompt templates, persona-based assistants, and context-aware AI assistants, with examples for each."  

---

## 4. Frameworks for GenAI Applications

**Prompt**:  
- "Compare LangSmith, LangGraph, and LangChain in terms of their main purpose, use cases, strengths, and visual interface for building and managing LLM-based applications."  

---

## 5. Suggested New Subtopics

### a. Evaluation and Monitoring of GenAI Applications

**Prompt**:  
- "What are common methods and tools for evaluating and monitoring the performance and reliability of generative AI applications?"

### b. Security and Privacy Considerations

**Prompt**:  
- "Discuss the key security and privacy considerations when deploying GenAI-based applications, including data handling and user privacy."

### c. Integration with External Tools and APIs

**Prompt**:  
- "How can generative AI applications be integrated with external databases, APIs, or knowledge sources to enhance their capabilities?"
