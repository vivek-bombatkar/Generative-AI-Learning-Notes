# 40 Agents | Reference Prompts and Stable Definitions

This document provides **reusable prompts** for each major subtopic related to AI Agents, with definitions only for concepts unlikely to become outdated. New subtopics are suggested where relevant, supporting concise and future-proof learning[1].

---

## 1. Agent (Core Concept)

**Definition**:  
An **agent** in AI is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.

**Prompt**:  
- "Explain what an AI agent is, including its core characteristics and how it differs from a standard LLM or chatbot."

---

## 2. Types of Agents

**Prompt**:  
- "List and describe common types of AI agents, such as reactive agents, deliberative agents, learning agents, and hybrid agents, with examples for each."

---

## 3. Agent Architecture

**Prompt**:  
- "Describe the typical architecture of an AI agent, including components like perception, reasoning, planning, action, and feedback loops."

---

## 4. Planning and Decision-Making in Agents

**Prompt**:  
- "How do AI agents perform planning and decision-making? Explain key techniques such as rule-based systems, search algorithms, and reinforcement learning."

---

## 5. Tool-Using Agents

**Prompt**:  
- "What are tool-using agents in the context of LLMs, and how do they interact with external tools, APIs, or databases to accomplish tasks?"

---

## 6. Multi-Agent Systems

**Prompt**:  
- "Explain the concept of multi-agent systems, including how multiple agents can collaborate or compete to solve complex problems."

---

## 7. Agent Memory and State Management

**Prompt**:  
- "Describe how agents manage memory and state across multiple interactions or tasks, and why this is important for long-term reasoning."

---

## 8. Evaluation of Agent Performance

**Prompt**:  
- "What metrics and methods are commonly used to evaluate the performance and reliability of AI agents?"

---

## 9. Applications and Use Cases of Agents

**Prompt**:  
- "List practical applications of AI agents in fields such as customer support, automation, data analysis, and personal assistance, with real-world examples."

---

## 10. Safety and Alignment in Agent Design

**Prompt**:  
- "Discuss the importance of safety and alignment in designing AI agents, and outline strategies to ensure agents act in accordance with user intentions and ethical guidelines."

---

## 11. Suggested New Subtopics

### a. Agent Communication and Coordination

**Prompt**:  
- "How do agents communicate and coordinate with each other in multi-agent environments, and what protocols or frameworks are commonly used?"

### b. Human-in-the-Loop Agents

**Prompt**:  
- "What is a human-in-the-loop agent, and how does human oversight improve agent reliability and decision-making?"

### c. Agent Autonomy Levels

**Prompt**:  
- "Describe different levels of agent autonomy, from simple rule-based automation to fully autonomous decision-making, and discuss their trade-offs."

---

---

## 🧩 Frameworks: LangChain vs CrewAI vs AutoGen
**Prompt:**  
> "Compare agent frameworks: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and SmolAI. Highlight their use cases, abstractions, and orchestration capabilities."

---

## 🔄 ReAct Prompting with Agents
**Prompt:**  
> "Describe how ReAct prompting (Reason + Act) enhances agent decision-making. Show an example with tool calls and feedback loops."

---
## 🌐 Agent + RAG
**Prompt:**  
> "Explain how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be embedded into an agent’s toolset. How does this improve accuracy in responses?"

---
## 🛡️ Agent Security
**Prompt:**  
> "What are the main risks in LLM agents calling tools or APIs (e.g., command injection, misuse)? How can we secure agent behavior?"

---

## 🧠 Reflection and Self-Correction
**Prompt:**  
> "How can agents be designed to reflect and revise incorrect or suboptimal responses? Explore techniques like self-critique and retry chains."


## 12. General Prompt for Any Agent Subtopic

- "Explain [subtopic] in the context of AI agents, including its definition, significance, and practical examples or implementation details."
